# SCDS origins #

* Gift from the Lewis and Ruth Sherman Foundation
* positioned for faculty collaboration
* Intended to be cross-disciplinary

.notes Library ideal for this, as we're #altac enough to have the collaborative
mindset but "academic" enough to, well, be academic. Libraries perhaps unique
in academy on this angle.

# Current state of SCDS #

* grand opening, uh, tomorrow!
* ... but we have projects already running!

.notes do do do! and then create a framework! Has definite disadvantages, in that without a proper frame sometimes you can get pushed around.

# Governance (original) #
* two directors -- academic, administrative
* academic director === faculty member
* cult of personality?

.notes Brief rundown of our original sitch. Stefan's genesis, Jeff runs with it, puts up the money, SS gets CRC, big deal, McGill. Again advantage library - we're less likely to scarper.

.notes OK, slight exaggeration here. But only slight. Being without an academic head puts a serious crimp in our style -- we are unable to take on any grant work, for instance. Not having a "real" faculty member also hurts our cred.

# So what can we do? #
* Internal projects
* "Plumbing"
* Grad students and other.

.notes Treat the DH centre as a library skunkworks. We have the flexibility, the know-how, and most of the infrastructure -- what can we then do with it that A) is *cheap* and B) not dependent on too many external partners?

# So who's this for? #
* Faculty
* Grad students
* maaaaaybe undergrads...
* ...*great* undergrads 
* others?

.notes Stress that initial target of grad students paying off 'cos they're hungry. Get grad students, presumably rest will follow. Detail experience talking to Christina Baade's folks, incl. general crappiness of their office. go over Dwayne's project. Note Mac concentration on STEM and how that's good -- focus on undeserved populations!

# Relationships outside #
* Lots of existing DH/DS centres
* National/regional partners
* Events, events, events.

.notes DH community still small enough to "know" and make an impact at nearly any level. Current cachet of #altac means that the collaborative model that libraries have always done well is getting more credence.

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# What's next? #
* ... opening would be a good start.
* getting the *right* project mix

.notes Working against the tide. One programmer, one sysadmin (gulp), compare to other DH that have jillions of employees. Mention copyright. At this juncture, got to make sure we can *do* projects.

!SLIDE bullets incremental 
# What's after next? #
* Serious research support
* Act as a hub/incubator for library innovation
* Scholarly communication

.notes I got nothin'.
