.notes Go a little deeper on the bio for this. Indulge your inner JT, just a wee tad. Contextual stuff. Mention SJSU if you have to. Note that nothing like this happened when you were in library school because you went to a diploma mill hosued in a Quonset hut.

.notes push this one heavy. Nothing would make me gladder than to have this entire "Sage-on-the-stage" load of horsehockey devolve into a groovy unconference setup.
