.notes Gauge some interest here. How many people tweet? Hopefully a lot. How many program? This will be important 'cos it is going to colour pretty much the rest of the speech. Make a note (during "interrupt"?) to please please please please ask people to stop you if you're going in weird/over the top directions especially wrt nerd-talk. Anyone have a github account?

.notes push this one heavy. Nothing would make me gladder than to have this entire "Sage-on-the-stage" load of horsehockey devolve into a groovy unconference setup. Go through each person in the audience, thank them for showing up :) and ask them *why* they showed up to this. What's their motivation? Any programmers? any interest in DH topics? What? anybody do Bill Turkel's lab?
