# structure matters #

.notes Can help or hurt. SCDS was initially a personality-driven project, geared for *specific* people. That helped immensely initially, but we were really thrown for a loop when that was gone. viz, the time (years!) between the original (likely) academic head's departure and the acquisition of a new one. HOWEVER, since we had a grant and therefore a mandate, we pushed on.

# Forget Taylorism #

.notes Ask if people know, then briefly explain Taylorism if needed. Many traditional library processes are built on scientific, discrete work blocks. e.g., 2 hour ref shift, weekly meetings, cataloguing. That can go out the window with DH.Projects (especially unfunded ones) can start and stop and in some cases the principal movers effectively vanish.

.notes hah, gotcha. I'm not going to talk about this, although if *you* want to talk about this I'm more than game to do so.

# How do *you* make this work? #
* you don't.

.notes Not to say that *you* don't. But one person can't. In order for this stuff to work, you need to prove you're in it for the long term. That means real, permanent staff, it means funding that is consistent from day to day, it means the understanding from Higher Powers that some projects will work and some won't, and it means having a space to work in.
