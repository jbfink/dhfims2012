.notes Can help or hurt. SCDS was initially a personality-driven project, geared for *specific* people. That helped immensely initially, but we were really thrown for a loop when that was gone. viz, the time (years!) between the original (likely) academic head's departure and the acquisition of a new one. HOWEVER, since we had a grant and therefore a mandate, we pushed on.

# Forget Taylorism #

.notes Ask if people know, then briefly explain Taylorism if needed. Many traditional library processes are built on scientific, discrete work blocks. e.g., 2 hour ref shift, weekly meetings, cataloguing. That can go out the window with DH.Projects (especially unfunded ones) can start and stop and in some cases the principal movers effectively vanish.
